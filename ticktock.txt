tick tock.

i am too restless to sleep.
Rachmaninoff is playing in the background
it is 4:00am
the clock replies
before i’ve even had a chance to ask.

tick tock.

screams the ennui
screams the insomnia
screams the empty bottle of whisky next to me
lying there
useless and beautiful.

tick tock.

Rachmaninoff crescendos into
something
something that he makes me long for
something that i wish i  was able
to make other people long for too.
something that
something.

tick tock.

is the sound of the liquid draining
as i take a long swig from epiphany
from the bottle of vodka i had forgotten about
until now.

tick tock.

Rachmaninoff segues into Op. 30 “Alla Breve”
the piano longs for the strings
the winds long for the brass
yet all i long for is sleep.

tick tock.

more vodka more inebriation
more inebriation more fatigue
until sleep is finally able to take me
is what is supposed to happen
is my rationality.
if only.

tick tock.

i take another drink.
now the vodka is half empty.
i feel good.
i feel happy.
i feel
everything but tired.
fuck.

tick tock.

screams the mocking clock.
the brass section enters at last
Rachmaninoff crescendos once more
the angry denouement approaches
in my head i can see the conductor sweating
i can see the solo trumpet about to have an aneurysm

tick tock.

drowns out the blaring euphoniums
drowns out the  screeching trombones
drowns out the melancholy of the crickets
outside my window
outside this feeling
outside.

tick tock.

it asks.
glug glug
i reply.
tick tock.
Rachmaninoff finishes
the vodka lies empty
i can shamelessly admit
i am drunk.

tick tock.

i am too drunk to care.
too drunk retaliate
too drunk to sleep.

tick tock.
tick tock.

the nausea is nothing
i am nothing
nothing is anything

tick tock.
screams the fucking clock.

4:01am.

tick. fucking. tock.
