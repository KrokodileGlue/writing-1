#### music.

music is just another one of those silly little things.  

a silly little thing that makes everything a little bit easier  
a silly little thing that make the world a little bit simpler  
a silly little thing that keeps you from drowning in your own existence  
as the dusk kills the day.  

music is just a silly little thing  
that makes everything so much more  
well  
more.  

it’s hard not to sigh in relief of myself as the applause slowly dies down  
the rhythmic popping of dusty vinyl quietly gives birth to mahler symphony no. 5  
proud trumpets dancing with timid clarinets  
ornery cymbals brawling with apathetic euphoniums  
myriad strings brashly trying to outdo one another  
bass and snare stoically humming sweet nothings to no one in particular  
cacophonous harmonies of major 7ths flirting with diminished 4ths  
the breathy staccatos of movement no. 1 “trauermarsch”  
a fluid, moving contradiction  
beauty calling itself a funeral procession  
as it tautologically proves  
the world might not be such a bad place after all.  

movement no. 2 gleefully taunts the ignorant american in me  
“stürmisch bewegt, mit größter sehemenz” which means  
(at least according to the irrefutable wikipedia)  
“moving stormily, with the greatest vehemence”  
and goddamn, does it ever.  

before i even realize it  
movement no. 3 bursts into existence  
“scherzo” my god  
i don’t even know up from down anymore  
trombones smash into the world  
woodwinds segue into brass like playing a game of bloody knuckles with cement  
there is a sudden raw guffaw of hypnotic trills and canon  
it is melting into  
something something something  
bloody french  
fancy jargon is no longer a priority  
struggling for breath  
scrambling for the words  
that could never do it justice.  

tick tock tick tock.  
where did the last ten minutes go?  
my body begs for respite  
please, Mahler, please  
give me a breather you savage bastard  
“crescendo. stringendo. accellerando.”  
are the only mercies i receive in reply  

and then it begins  
oh my god  
does it fucking begin.  
movement no. 4 “adagietto”  
in german, “sehr langsam”  
an imperative statement, “always slowly”  
ha. ha.  
as if anyone could make it through this fucking thing  
without dying horribly  
without loving shamefully  
without existing terribly  
without being murdered by bits of rapture and fleeting emotions  
without being having your sanity consumed by counterpoint and cadence  
i no longer care that she forgot about a promise made by two stupid teenagers  
i no longer care that i have far too much debts owed to nameless strangers  
i no longer care about bridges burnt with regret, back where the water used to be  
I don’t know how i ever forgot,  
Mahler you beautiful bastard of a cold dead corpse,  
how you make me feel so goddamn alive.  

movement no. 5 enters  
subtle arpeggios remind me of simpler days  
warm doting mothers and cereal soggy with milk  
i can never think straight after no. 4  
at last, no. 5 “rondo (final)”  
Mahler you wonderful fucker  
once again you’ve turned me into a quivering wreck of a human being  
i wonder why hubris tastes like the ass swig of an old whiskey bottle  
i wonder why words only come when everyone else has left  
a tired giggling of flutes faintly echoes somewhere  
a lonely french horn’s F# fades into the silence of a softer world  
a tinge of longing for something you’ve convinced yourself was nothing  
it’s funny how those always hurt oh so well.  

maybe icarus wasn’t such a sad story after all  
just a power outage in the sky  
it’s better than complaining to god on hospital floors  
angrily coveting the beautiful things we forgot we already are  
at least the wax melted  
before any of his dreams did.
