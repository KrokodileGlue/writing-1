oh, how you gaze at me
whisper sweet nothings in my ear
god, such seductive yearnings

-i'm the only answer.

to questions asked by you alone.

well tonight
it's your turn to be alone.
i hope you enjoy 
that fucking couch because
this bed
this night 

is mine tonight.

so fuck off
and shut the fuck up.

because for once
i'm tired of listening.
because for once
you don't get to win.

not tonight, motherfucker.

not tonight.
