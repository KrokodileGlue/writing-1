Very soft.
 
Hello, my name is Nick; at least, that's what I'll tell you it is. This is nothing but a irrelevant memoir, a retelling of all that I find worth writing about, so in that respect you understand why I can't be fully truthful. I don't know why you're reading this, and to be honest I don't know why I'm writing it either, but the fact remains; these words are here, as are you.
I am an alcoholic, a drug addict, a chain-smoker, and for all intents and purposes, absolutely and positively depressed. Drugs are all that keep me sane nowadays. I'm not addicted to THEM per say, but addicted to the simple lack of sobriety. I drink by myself at night often, and the only reason I am able to live my productive life is the amphetamines, thank god. That’s the secret. All it is is simple amphetamines.
I trust barely anyone. As of now, I trust no one with my secrets, and deep down inside, even though I’m the happiest person to everyone else, I’m fucking cynical, sad, and lonely. I always think the worst of people. I’m only nice to the world because it benefits me in relation to others. I’m also a mess. Deep down inside, I’m a big broken mess, and this is the first time I’ve really confessed it, under the influence of more drugs than I can count on one hand.
This story will be rough and fragmented at times, vulgar and blunt at others, but that's because this is my story. This is my unfiltered life. These are my hopes, my dreams, my fears, my wants. These are my loves, my hates, my indescribables, my apathetic “okay's.” This is a collection of lot of things. But in the end, past every other adjective and noun, every lexicon and appendix;
 
this is my story. 
 
So please stay and read. That’s all this broken confession can ask for.
