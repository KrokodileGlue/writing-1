## manic.

_everyone_understands.

we trade in our dated *justices*,
our obsolescent *orders*.
but oh—in return?!
the shiny, the new, the incredibly distracting!

there are still *orders* _everywere_ anyway;
online, offline, awake, asleep,
some come with complimentary Starbucks,
some come with /"It's complicated,"/
and all are shipped to _anywere_ in the world.

so is this out justice v2.0.0-rc1?
days spent blurry and 𝓬𝓱𝓪𝓸𝓽𝓲𝓬;
hoping, praying, that one day,
maybe, just maybe,
we'll reach the top?

maybe one day—the writing on the wall
will start to seem a little clearer…
those whispy, grey strands of wisdom.
slowly drowing in apathy.

maybe one day—our comedic struggle of life
will permit a few specks of sanity…
glistening like the first Easter Egg of the year;
hidden in the holes where our attention-spans used to be.

maybe one day—nothing special
will happen at all…
nothing will become of anything;
the dusk murdered by night,
the mourning's endless blue skies,
scattered pandemonium,
manic, helpless, complacent,
as we lie there,
slowly, beautifully,
drowning in our own wanderlust.
