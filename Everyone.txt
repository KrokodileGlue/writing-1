Everyone has one little compulsion in them. A little thing that affects absolutely
everything in that person's life, everything, they do, say and feel. It is not
visible at surface level, but it is always there. It could be the result
of a childhood experience, or just something was always there, but once it is
known, it can be used to read everything about a person.
