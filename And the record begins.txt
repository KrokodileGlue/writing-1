And the record begins with a song of rebellion.
We are the future.

We the pill-poppers and dope smokers, will run your government.

We the chain-smoking rebels, with our BB guns and iPods, will manage the economy.

We the addicts, of technology, of constant visual stimulations, with our attention spans shorter than our tempers, will be your judge, jury, and executioner.

We the broken-hearted, forged jaded and cold by society and it’s innate flaws, will be your cooks, your cab drivers, your janitors.

We the unloved and misunderstood, driven to self-loathing by starvation of simple compassion and empathy, will teach your children.

We are the sad, broken, hedonistic future.

And we will seek nothing but rapture when our time comes.

So be careful what bridges you burn, it’s not very hard to get burned in return.

We. Are. The. Future.
