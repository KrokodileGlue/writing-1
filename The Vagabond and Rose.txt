the young vagabond scribbled in the sand, fatigued and overwhelmed by his life's course lately. He had every right to be happy. He really did.<br><br>

<b>But sometimes it's really not good enough; in this cold, broken world of ours.</b><br><br>

With the oasis around him silent agreement, the wanderer sighed dejectedly; when suddenly a sharp pain stabbed at his palm.<br><br>

<i>-Fuck!</i><br><br>

Was what he uttered quite loudly; though regret washed over his features when he realized what had been sharing this fleeting moment with him the entire time.<br><br>

<b>Growing out here, in this god-forsaken desert? How?</b><br><br>

<i>-A rose...</i><br><br>

The words leaving the young boy's lips seemed to do no justice; for here in this pinnacle of desolation, there was a lone rose growing in the sand.<br><br>

<b>What cruel irony; here lays beauty incarnate! Surrounded by the forgotten ashes of the world, and with nothing else to keep her company but a jaded vagabond, marred by the horrors of a thousand lifetimes.</b><br><br>

He laughed to himself; who wouldn't? And for a second he forgot his troubles. Forgot his past, present, and future, and just sat.<br><br>

<i>-Stricken with loneliness in this horrible place, and the only company God can afford to send me is you?</i><br><br>

<b>How can you give me any sort of happiness? You wouldn't understand a second of my life. I've been through hell and back! Desecrated graves, killed children; the <i>Cardinal Sins</i> have basically been the tenets of my waking life!</b><br><br>

<i>-"Introibo Ad Altare Dei!" For I must give him thanks for grinding salt into this gaping hole of a heart.</i><br><br>

The lonely boy was now feeling the creeping malaise of loneliness gripping his bones. Because to be put quite simply; he really was alone.<br><br>

<b>Who am I to trust? All of my family, brothers, sisters; all of them not a shred of loyalty, camaraderie, or even just simple compassion. I've been broken by this world, so why should I trust  my executioner?</b><br><br>

<i>-Yet here you are! Innocence, Purity; everything that contradicts this forsaken earth! Such a simple flower could know nothing of pain, death, or despair. And for that reason, you could never fill the gap in this tainted soul.</i><br><br>

But then the boy stopped. He looked at his bloody hand, still throbbing from those sharp, emarald thorns. The rose had given its harsh retort, before the boy had even asked the question.<br><br>

<i>-Even in all of your virginity, you draw my blood; a greater feat than man or beast has been able to accomplish to this day.</i><br><br>

<b>I guess it really goes to show what real strength is. This facade is getting heavy, and my heart tires of solitude.</b><br><br>

Grinning as he rose to his feet, the vagabond remembered something.<br><br>

-If nothing else, take my words as thanks; it's not every day you get to meet an angel.<br><br>

With pristine care, he finished his vignette in the sand next to the rose.<br><br>

-I've found someone at last who will do them justice.<br><br><br><br>
