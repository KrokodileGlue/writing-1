<p>the screech of cellphones
breaking the calm night</p>
<br>

<p>staring at ceilings
pushing down nausea
fighting imaginary demons
antiseptic and cold</p>
<br>

<p>i can't know it right now
but this will be
the most important call
of my life</p>
<br>

<p>i'm much too drunk
much too annoyed
at nothing
at everything</p>
<br>

<p>i can't close my eyes
for fear of throwing up
so fuck it
i answer</p>
<br>

<p>i am ashamed to admit,
i can't even remember
what we talked about
that night</p>
<br>

<p>i can't remember what
or who
or why
or when</p>
<br>

<p>i just remember you.</p>
<br>

<p>i remember whisky
i rmemeber laughter
i remember rapture
i remember lighting
i remember ambien
i temmeber corny jokes
i remmeber metaphors of love</p>
<br>

<p>i remember nails
scarring my back
apocalyptic and colorblind.</p>
<br>

<p>everything is a blur after that
everything seemed to move
far too fast
time fidgeting
under the weight of you</p>
<br>

<p>i don't know why
it all`seems so far now
there were wonderful nights
elation
smilesâ€”</p>
<br>

<p>the smalls of our backs
staining the bedsheets underneath us
the smell of you
my poison of choice</p>
<br>

<p>the days now are forced and lonely
useless people
with useless problems</p>
<br>

<p>rain where the music used to be.</p>
<br>

<p>the rooftops are silent
wet and damp
the night is screaming
the stars pretending calm</p>
<br>

<p>i guess maybe someday
i'll figure out the truth
i guess maybe some days
you need nights like this</p>
<br>

<p>nights full of cigarette smoke</p>
<br>

<p>silent and useless.</p>
<br>
