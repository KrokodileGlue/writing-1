[vagabonds of vowels, we.]

    we,
    the poets.
    the novelists.
    the unemployed.
    the unnoticed.

    all of us writers
    telling a story
    with consonants and vowels
    with rhymes, reason, and rebellion
    at times philosophers with no equals
    at time salsa-dancing with ourselves
    on the fringes of sanity.

    why you ask
    did we choose this?
    why starve, why fight,
    why struggle, why write?

    well, god gave us seven sins and seven virtues
    but us mortals
    as we cry out
    screaming
    speaking against the sun
    blinded
    by that bright coin-flip in the sky

    six questions
    is all we could come up with.
    five fucking “w”s
    and a lone “h”

    but we?

    we are the restless
    we are the lustful
    we are the unsatisfied
    revolutionaries!
    (in our heads at least.)

    but it’s a matter of life or death
    dream or die, motherfucker!
    lest the wanderlust
    eat you alive.

    so we let god do his thing
    chanting 'till his flashlight comes on.
    i mean
    we didn’t even exist yet.
    and not like we could part the sea
    or command the dusk to kill the day
    so we waited.

    we let him make giraffes and chinchillas
    as he told them to fuck and make more
    giraffes and chinchillas.

    then we let him make us.
    but that lazy fuck
    didn’t finish what he started!
    "sabbath" my ass.

    so on the seventh day WE said,
    —let there be words!
    “ain’t no rest for the wicked” as they say
    so on the seventh day
    came the death of silence
    murder by metaphor
    because now
    we exist.

    the ones born to write.

    born into this
    oh vagabonds of vowels, we!
    we are the madmen
    wielding dictionaries
    thesauruses
    we are the innocent
    the archaic

    i still have each library card from my youth
    as if they were something more
    than just faded scraps of plastic
    because now we have condominiums and timeshares
    where the sun used to be.

    so all i can do now
    is try and answer
    those six question marks.
    those six marks of our mortality.

    i suppose that counted
    as an answer to “why” we write.
    so now you ask
    “who” are we?
    “who” are the writers?

    we are roses without thorns
    we are the drunks, the drug-addicts, the unstable
    we are the sober, the working-class, the average
    we are the geniuses, the savants, the damned

    we are origami roses
    the insomnia and the empty pill bottles
    the whiskey, wine, and cigarettes
    where our thorns used to be.

    so don’t fuck with us.
    because papercuts hurt like a bitch.

    please excuse the rambling style by the way
    mr. editor.

    and thank you not only for revising
    remaking
    rebuilding
    this disjointed wall of words

    but also thank you
    because you spend your days
    polishing the metaphors of madmen
    making beauty
    out of oh so many beasts.

    helios, allah, yahweh, apollo, elohim, jehova
    or just god i guess?

    i’ll humor you today
    and pick up where you left off.
    as i’ve already done the “who” and the “why”
    a portrait of the writer
    my best attempt to caricature
    this chronic disease of ours.

    it’s warm
    subtle
    an ache in our hearts.
    it’s a longing for that wonderful chaos
    those few ravishing sentences
    hidden
    in the spaces between our emotions.

    sick are we
    from the cradle to the grave
    with this pain that will never leave us
    never abandon us
    never betray us.
    slow
    dull
    throbbing
    a pain that hurts oh so well.

    oh, and as you have probably discerned by now
    i am not much for order
    so humor me
    i’m trying to do math with the alphabet here, after all.

    as i multiply each word
    upon sentence
    upon poem
    upon prose

    then i add everything
    to this A.D.D. of mine
    to my carpal tunnel
    to my cubital tunnel

    but “where” the fuck
    is the the LIGHT
    that should be there
    at the end of my tunnel?

    “where” the fuck
    have the words gone
    when i needed them the most?

    still, i can’t help myself
    i love writing, i must confess,
    though my nerves may burn
    i’ll just use them to light my cigarettes.

    because all i want
    because all i've ever wanted
    is for it all to equal something in the end.
    something real.

    dear god, the “when”
    the when is torture.
    i must confess for this piece alone
    i spent a week holed up in empty rooms and stifling garages
    making wishes to the genie of my ashtray.
    hoping against hope
    drowning the hours
    drowning myself

    in sleepless nights and menthol lights.

    so i read.
    and readreadereadreadreadREAD.
    goddammit.

    'cause fuck writer’s block.
    it is a hangover like no other.
    from nights spent binging
    on cheap plastic bottles
    of nouns, verbs, pronouns, adjectives, adverbs
    on too many shots of goddamn grammar
    chased with glass after glass
    of bitter prepositions.

    but that’s all past-tense now
    because it was all worth it.
    i am now typing this with frantic abandon
    the words have finally replied to my love letters
    as Mahler sings in the background
    as the crickets chirp in tune with the world

    and the night—

    ah, for once—

    the night is beautiful.

    so “who” writers are
    “why” we write
    “when” the words flood your very being, drowning you, Noah, and his whole fucking ark.
    “when” the words leave you alone with three cars loans, two kids, and one broken heart.
    “where” did they go?
    “where” shall we elope to once we’ve found each other again?

    there are too many things to say

    about pens and paper
    about typewriters and laptops
    about laughter and whiskey
    about the blood, sweat, and tears
    about the many trite axioms and shallow metaphors
    about rare moments of genius and wondrous masterpieces
    about every fucking inch of our insides and outsides

    about the letters
    the words
    the sentences
    the stanzas
    the poetry
    the prose
    the stories
    the novels

    the art.

    because “what” we are not
    “what” writing is not
    writing is not anything close

    NOTHING

    like the facade worn by that final “h”

    A LIE.

    the biggest of all.
    because it doesn’t matter “how” we write.

    fuck.
    that.

    it doesn’t mean shit

    how large your vocabulary is.
    how numerous your synonyms, antonyms, homonyms,
    or just plain old sins are.
    how high your IQ is.
    how low your self-esteem is.
    how drunk, or high,
    or stoned, or sober you are.
    how much Shakespeare you have digested.
    how well you have know the works of Frost, Hemingway, Ezra, or Steinbeck.
    how—shit—IF
    you even know who Gorky, Lawrence, cummings, Huxley, Thoreau,
    or either of the Sinclairs even are.

    none of it matters.
    none of those things mean shit at all.

    because “what” writing is
    “what” the wondrous truth is
    behind that scarlet “h”
    worn proudly by the few

    the writers and singers
    and housewives and criminals
    and actors and presidents
    and six-figure CEOs
    and even cold corpses six-feet under the stars

    who have left their legacies on an 8.5″x11″ canvas
    an unflinching immortality
    wrought from their anxieties
    their desires
    their thoughts
    their feelings
    their hopes
    their dreams

    their despair
    their pain
    their bits of rapture
    and fleeting fucking emotions.

    their entire life savings!
    all of it a toll.
    the price to cross
    this ugly, burnt bridge.

    but jesus, man,
    just tell us already!

    “what” the fuck is on the other side?
    “what” could possibly be worth any of this?
    “what” does that useless fucking “h” stand for
    if the “how” doesn’t mean shit?

    “what”
    “what”
    “WHAT”
    is writing?

    well,
    it’s the only thing
    that will always be there to remind us

    even through all of this shit
    even if the sun explodes
    even if the trees all die and the earth withers black
    even if the wars of men reduce billions to hundreds
    even if the reaper himself is driven mad
    overworked.

    death
    now sick
    of death.

    even if the deafening silence of nothing
    moves into the houses and suburbs
    into the cities and sidewalks
    into the streets and schools
    where the cacophony of car-horns
    and the laughter of children used to be.

    and though most of it will be gone
    most of it burnt and discarded
    most of it torn and trashed
    most of it used as towels and toilet paper

    but most?

    is never all.

    and the writing that will still exist
    will remind those few poor souls
    those survivors of an unresponsive god
    that the one thing

    no crazed man
    no ravenous beast
    no apathetic deity
    can kill—

    is “hope.”
    we,
    the poets.
    the novelists.
    the unemployed.
    the unnoticed.

    all of us writers
    telling a story
    with consonants and vowels
    with rhymes, reason, and rebellion

    (in our heads at least.)

    but it’s a matter of life or death
    dream or die, motherfucker!
    lest the wanderlust
    eat you alive.

    so we let god do his thing
    making the light and shit.
    i mean
    we didn’t even exist yet.
    and not like we could part the sea
    or command the dusk to kill the day
    so we waited.
    we let him make giraffes and chinchillas

    then we let him make us.
    but that lazy fuck

    sabbath my ass.

    so on the seventh day WE said,
    —let there be words!
    “ain’t no rest for the wicked” as they say
    so on the seventh day
    came the death of silence
    murder by metaphor
    because now

    the ones born to write.
