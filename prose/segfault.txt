[segfault.]

cold.
anger.
white.

the ceiling shouts metaphors as our bodies tangle together
carpet burns melt into stifled moans
i can't see past your hair anymore.

your voice is my dulcet muse
jesus would be wasted on you
who needs a star in the sky when i have one right here?

oh god oh god oh god oh god.

we are cliched voices; pounding against the the walls of the world.
twitching memories and trembling souls
virgin and crazy lying soaked in ourselves.

i think your eyes are where he hid that fucking apple.

scars
skin
contented sighs and writhing breaths

you are my original sin
you are my second coming
i am lying here in rusted moments

mangled in your religion.
