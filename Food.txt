there is a lot you can do with $70 In fact I think that's about what I spend.

First of all do not go to a high end grocery store. Albertsons is a no no. They jack up the prices of your bread cause they also have jumbo crab legs in the store.


My mom always told me these are the basics you need even if you are poor. The rest is details.

Milk, eggs, bread, cheese, peanut butter.

In addition you need: butter, mayo, coffee/tea, cinnamon, a chicken, 1 pound of ground beef, soup, cereal of your choice.

All that should run you 40-50.

Spend the rest on food you don't need but just like to have around.
