In weakness be
I let you see
I give myself to thee
For what is love
But eternal rest
A chance to be set free

---------- editation ---------------

honestly,
i couldn't care less
what people say about you.
all that matters
is how i precieve you right?
someone could tell me
a million horrible things about you,
& i would still look at you
& only see the person
i've always known you to be.
nothing more, nothing less.
isn't that how it's supposed to be?
they'll pull me away from you,
but i'll end up right where i began.
in your arms, where i want to be.
only i know what is truely right for me.
what i need in life, what i don't.
no one can change what i want,
or alter my feelings for you.
i'm beginning to get scared,
the more i hear your voice,
the more i feel your touch,
the more i want you.
the more sure my feelings grow.
& i'm afraid,
this is changing into more than
i believedi t would blossom into.
you've caught hold of my heart,
so fast.
i don't care what you do,
as long as you're with me :]
i'll always be here for you,
no matter what people may say.
