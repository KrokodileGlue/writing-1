Cblarg, Bblarg, I dunno wtf at 5 fret then 7 fret - A,B,C,D

The chorus shines bright in my ears
As I breathe in each note like smoke
My love songs are on repeat
each chord a small glimer of hope

Picking 5 fret and 7 fret
that I have a small chance
with this angel to bring
an offering
on these mortal strings

A,D,A,B,A,D,C,D
The strength to move mountains
Soft hands she can hold
compassion of poor men
Yet mountains of gold
It's what she deserves
i guess I'm pretty far
Cause all I can offer
is me and my guitar

picking 5 and 7 fret

Verse
Each word comes out broken and cold
As i fight just to smile and say hi
You eyes seem to pierce straight through me
they burn like the sun in the sky

bridge
So I sit here and practice
What I'm gonna say
Yet I can't say a word

A,D,A,B,A,D,C,D
The strength to move mountains
Soft hands she can hold
compassion of poor men
Yet mountains of gold
It's what she deserves
i guess I'm pretty far
Cause all I can offer
is me

A,D,A,B,A,D,C,A
The strength to move mountains
Soft hands she can hold
compassion of poor men
Yet mountains of gold
It's what she deserves
i guess I'm pretty far
Cause all I can offer
is me... and my guitar
