music is just another one of those silly little things{}.\newline
\newline
\newline
a silly little thing that makes everything a little bit easier\newline
a silly little thing that make the world a little bit simpler\newline
a silly little thing that keeps you from drowning in your own existence\newline
as the dusk kills the day{}.\newline
\newline
\newline
music is just a silly little thing\newline
that makes everything so much more\newline
well\newline
more{}.\newline
\newline
\newline
it’s hard not to sigh in relief of myself as the applause slowly dies down\newline
the rhythmic popping of dusty vinyl quietly gives birth to mahler symphony no. 5\newline
proud trumpets dancing with timid clarinets\newline
ornery cymbals brawling with apathetic euphoniums\newline
myriad strings brashly trying to outdo one another\newline
bass and snare stoically humming sweet nothings to no one in particular\newline
cacophonous harmonies of major 7ths flirting with diminished 4ths\newline
the breathy staccatos of movement no. 1 “trauermarsch”\newline
a fluid, moving contradiction\newline
beauty calling itself a funeral procession\newline
as it tautologically proves\newline
the world might not be such a bad place after all{}.\newline
\newline
\newline
movement no. 2 gleefully taunts the ignorant american in me\newline
“stürmisch bewegt, mit größter sehemenz” which means\newline
(at least according to the irrefutable wikipedia)\newline
“moving stormily, with the greatest vehemence”\newline
and goddamn, does it ever{}.\newline
\newline
\newline
before i even realize it\newline
movement no. 3 bursts into existence\newline
“scherzo” my god\newline
i don’t even know up from down anymore\newline
trombones smash into the world\newline
woodwinds segue into brass like playing a game of bloody knuckles with cement\newline
there is a sudden raw guffaw of hypnotic trills and canon\newline
it is melting into\newline
something something something\newline
bloody french\newline
fancy jargon is no longer a priority\newline
struggling for breath\newline
scrambling for the words\newline
that could never do it justice{}.\newline
\newline
\newline
tick tock tick tock{}.\newline
where did the last ten minutes go?\newline
my body begs for respite\newline
please, Mahler, please\newline
give me a breather you savage bastard\newline
“crescendo{}.\ stringendo{}.\ accellerando{}.”\newline
are the only mercies i receive in reply\newline
\newline
\newline
and then it begins\newline
oh my god\newline
does it fucking begin{}.\newline
movement no. 4 “adagietto”\newline
in german, “sehr langsam”\newline
an imperative statement, “always slowly”\newline
ha{}.\ ha{}.\newline
as if anyone could make it through this fucking thing\newline
without dying horribly\newline
without loving shamefully\newline
without existing terribly\newline
without being murdered by bits of rapture and fleeting emotions\newline
without being having your sanity consumed by counterpoint and cadence\newline
i no longer care that she forgot about a promise made by two stupid teenagers\newline
i no longer care that i have far too much debts owed to nameless strangers\newline
i no longer care about bridges burnt with regret, back where the water used to be\newline
I don’t know how i ever forgot,\newline
Mahler you beautiful bastard of a cold dead corpse,\newline
how you make me feel so goddamn alive{}.\newline
\newline
\newline
movement no. 5 enters\newline
subtle arpeggios remind me of simpler days\newline
warm doting mothers and cereal soggy with milk\newline
i can never think straight after no. 4\newline
at last, no. 5 “rondo (final)”\newline
Mahler you wonderful fucker\newline
once again you’ve turned me into a quivering wreck of a human being\newline
i wonder why hubris tastes like the ass swig of an old whiskey bottle\newline
i wonder why words only come when everyone else has left\newline
a tired giggling of flutes faintly echoes somewhere\newline
a lonely french horn’s F# fades into the silence of a softer world\newline
a tinge of longing for something you’ve convinced yourself was nothing\newline
it’s funny how those always hurt oh so well{}.\newline
\newline
\newline
maybe icarus wasn’t such a sad story after all\newline
just a power outage in the sky\newline
it’s better than complaining to god on hospital floors\newline
angrily coveting the beautiful things we forgot we already are\newline
at least the wax melted\newline
before any of his dreams did.\newline
