why am i so good at this
these jokes where i’m the punchline
as i lie on this fucking floor
wishing for the words to come.

only silence
cold, clean tiles
and bubblewrapped angels
where the butterflies used to be.

i was right i suppose
about that whole not forcing words shit
but goddamn
the irony is a bit ludicrous.

—“Adversus solem ne loquitor.”
—don’t speak against the sun.
i don’t even remember where i heard it
but still:

what a crock of shit.
i see you up there.
so well played god; well played.
you win this round.

you fuck.
