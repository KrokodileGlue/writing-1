"action without action"
"effortless doing"
an unassuming tao concept
it's something i often think about.

simple.
tiny.
confusing.
with gravity.

i have so many fucking words
i have so many fucking letters
i have so many fucking thoughts
that i want to get out.

i have wants.
i have needs.
i have lusts.
i have cravings.

i have jealousies.
i have pains.
i have hurts.
i have resentments.

but even more than that,
i have fears.
i have scars.
i have reservations.

—who the fuck am i?

"don't dwell on the details"
"don't use passive voice"
"don't write in first person"
"don't overuse adverbs"

—who the fuck are they?

who is the subject of this object?
what if i'm not an active kind of person?
when am i going to find
wherever it is that i'm looking for?

and how am i supposed to find
with all of this goddamn static
this fucking thing
that i am supposed to be?

'lo she lay
red
tarred and feathered.
at least part of me is having a good time.

schizophrenia must be something to someone
who cares where your friends come from?
is it so wrong to make believe?
do you really need rough sex to feel alive?

so fuck it
live a little
let go goddamit
forget about everything for once.

drink the colors of night
sing songs of shitty regrets
watch boring movies
write boring monologues

the drink won't give you courage forever
the legato will fade
diminishing into adagios
muted, cold staccato.

so dear me;
savor the ennui
find strength in the fear
lay out the words in your head.

write, you fuck
who cares if forcing metaphors
counts as a sin?
one thing is for sure;

lying to yourself is.
