whether you like it or not.

about every unrequited poem you write; each word dripping with cold, silver emotion.
about every smile you fake, every tear you hide, and every scream you stifle.
someone has been listenening to your uncommented covers of love songs;
to those lonely hours of practice in the corner of some obscure band room.
someone empathizes with every caustic rant.
every heart-breaking confession you spill.
every obscure profession of love, typed with heavy hands and an even heavier heart.
someone is proud of you for that unappreciated a in english.
of that beautiful solo when your crush was just a little too late to the concert.
of every accomplishment that you thought mattered to no one but yourself.
it matters to someone that you weren’t invited to that party.
that she picked him over you.
that he lied to you, and you were naive enough to believe him.
and that some part of you still does.
someone doesn’t think it stupid that you talk to your food.
that sometimes you like books more than you like people.
that some days all you want to do is eat otter pops and watch cartoons.
and someone really just wants you to know,
that he appreciates every shy glance you shoot him.
that she loves how you call her for no reason other than to hear her voice.
that he thinks you’re prettier in a t-shirt and shorts than a skirt and all the make-up in the world.
and that it would shatter her fragile world if you didn’t wake up this time, as the empty bottle of sleeping pills on the floor becomes the only friend she has left.
so don’t ever forget:

someone cares.

whether you like it or not.
