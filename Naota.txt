I hope Joey knows that I appreciate him for everything he’s done and that I’m scared for the friendship because I don’t want him going back to drugs and I don’t think it helps that he spins at raves, where all you do, is drugs. I hope we spend more time together because I don’t remember the last LCC we’ve had and I always try to remember the night outside my house and I always try to remember that no matter what, you’ll be there for me.
