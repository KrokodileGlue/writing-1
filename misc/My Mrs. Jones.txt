3-0-0,2-0-0,0-0-0,2-0-0
The night stutters as your eyes pierce into me
The day smiles with every single word you breathe
The stars themselves are blocked out by your smile
So is it fine if I stay a while?

G, C/G, Am, D
And I-
just sit alone tonight
with my eyes shut tight
wishing on the star so bright
that I-
could right all of my wrongs
could sing all of my songs
because one day without you- is one day too long
