Andrew: i know it’s irrelevant now but i was thinking about what that guy sent to you and it’s actually super funny. you see, his ‘logical reasoning’ is anything but that. i mean instead of just accepting the fact that you just flat out didn’t like him, he had to go into this whole melodramatic harangue of sorts. basically he was in disbelief and shock that you had no interest in him after you sobered up. you were drunk and maybe that was just part of his plan, who knows but think about the inebriation factor that he so timely used to his advantage because your vulnerability to the situation was at it’s peak pretty much and he used that chance because he knew it would be beneficial for him to get you to go out with him with no questions asked. it was more or less like a ‘now or never’ scenario pretty much. even though it’s pretty extreme to get someone drunk just so they’ll agree to go out with you but idk maybe that’s just me. well unable to accept rejection, he inevitably counteracted his emotions by calling you a psycho with emotional issues. not saying that isn’t true……. jokes. nah but really what was up with the carnal catharsis. ha ha ha his speech was so righteous.

Honestly.
I am like a wildfire and the people that attempt to vanquish me with argumentative methods are like fuel to me.
I love it (no sarcasm inputted there) I really really do enjoy it.



UNFORTUNATELY, I have self-diagnosed A.D.D. and get bored easily (and I am officially too bored with this situation to continue on with the lame back and forth quarrel) but feel free to talk to me when you think of something else to whine like a little bitch about.


In so many words.
Andrew: You really need to stop this. 
Me: Stop what? 
Andrew: Toying with helpless boy's minds. 
Me: You're one to talk. From what I remember, you used to toy with helpless girl's minds on a daily basis. 
Andrew: Yeah, USED to. I don't anymore. I met you and it made me not want to do that stupid shit anymore. 
Me: Really? 
Andrew: Yeah. Something like that. Idk. You're just like the one person I want to do good shit with. Even though that stupid shit was a little fun.



Success.
My plan worked.
I need to get bored more often and make people unknowingly look like complete ass hats.
I mean, it’s kind of childish for me to do what I just did but I needed a good laugh and it was the easiest way to get it done.
Shaunie is laughing too which makes me happy since she’s been having a kind of bad night.
:)



I'm really bored.
So I’m going through people’s Tumblrs and I came across one that really interested me. So I am going to do a little experiment that I think will be fun and make this person look like a total fool and tool. We will see how it pans out.




I will forever stand tall with a clenched fist in one hand and crossed fingers in the other because I will forever have these two sides of myself complementing one another when needed. They go hand-in-hand, both figuratively and literally.

I will forever keep the madness that subsides within me exerting from the fire in my glares. And isn’t it amazing how I am able to hold innumerable lies in the palm of my hand to use to my advantage at any given moment? How great to have weapons such as these, that of which are bestowed upon me by nature.

One, two, and you’re down.
If not by the white of my knuckles, then by my superior knowledge in all things rhetorically insulting.

I will defeat you and break you down to the core if you cross me with invalid reason. And let it be known that no such weaponry exists to mask my indomitable nature.

To those who choose to oppose me, I feel obligated to offer you the chance to walk away and discontinue your treading on this path marked as my territory.
Assuming that you really don’t know what I am capable of.
Although, at this point, we all know, I am salivating over the thought of your bones crushed and feelings ruptured.
So, in my hands I hold out two expressions, and I am giving you the chance to pick one or the other, which is not something I would normally do for anyone, so what will it be? A coaxing finger, or a finger pointing outward and away.
Which will speak to you the loudest?
Because both are screaming sadistic laughter in my ears.
Come here, darling. Take a seat next to me. Let me breathe you in. Your naivety makes me feel like a little kid again.
I was born with a permanent shield and a shameless, fearlessness that some might refer to as insanity.
So don’t walk so proudly into the dark, you foolish and arrogant child.
Your confidence and carelessness is no match for my experience on this battle ground.
For what are you fighting? Do you even know? Or has your narrow-minded persona emotionally handicapped you?
Save your broken sorrow speech for someone who actually cares enough to pretend to care.
You intend for your words to be daggers upon myself but don’t you know the damage my words can cause to the soft-hearted?
Don’t you know the countless ways I can manipulate words to kill even the most fearless animals?
Or must I show you an example for you to fully grasp this concept?
I am patient and I have time if you require such a lesson as this.
We could have ended things on a civilized note.
I don’t know what compelled you to choose this path but I can assure you, you will regret it entirely.
Do you honestly think that a week from now you or your friends or your petty words will hold any significance in my life?
Oh, you did? Well then I gladly challenge you to that because truth is, your memory lies nowhere but between the soil in the ground and soles of my feet.
I will walk all over you for as long as I wish. Don’t you ever forget that.
You can dig and dig under my skin to try and get to me but I can only hope that you are aware of the fact that I am invincible and I do not break as easily as my bones may.
I will continue to embed myself into your scar tissue and when I begin to invade. I will tangle with your veins and cut off your circulation.
And like the uneducated domestic puppies that you are, you will try to bite at me.
But kids, I’ve got words of wisdom aged like fine wine and my mind is a museum.
I am a sin eater. A record of strangers’ secrets.
And what a cowardly way to face your contender for the first time.
Your chance to use ignorance as a way out is no longer an option.
You attempted to undermine me. Big big mistake.
You pure little delicate flowers. I will grind your petals to parent my war paint.
But come, I beg you, all of you, closer to my iron tower body. I stand tall.
I can only hope that you really are enough of an idiot to try and foolishly swing at me again.
You deserve to remain unwhole for the rest of your life.
But also, every person whose life you still remain in, deserves the arduous task of rebuilding you unsuccessfully over and over.
Your nails may be longer than mine, but my teeth will cut so much deeper.

Be careful of what doors you open.
For some of them you aren’t strong enough to close when reality scratches at your corneas.
I know nothing of mercy or benevolence.

Just thought I’d fling myself chest first into this one.
Just to try my chances at coming out with starry eyes.
What I would give to shine like I used to.
I’ll start by nonchalantly skipping my way down the rabbit hole because this time, I’ve got nothing but time and the feeling that I’ve finally been plugged into the right socket.
If it feels right, it must be right, if you’re the only one left, it will be all right.
I can hear the cogs clicking over in my head start up again, a preaching machine with purpose and my sins cheering for redemption.
Smiles spewing ribbon and confetti with our eyes wide like balloons always flying home for the stars.
I came across someone that shines like I used to, so bright, he blinded my world.

By the way, I'm liking you a little bit more everyday, Joey. Just thought you should know. Okay, good night!

I know I needed change and for some reason in the back of my mind, I thought this is the change that I wanted but I can’t see clearly if this is the good or bad kind of change and it gives me an uneasy, uncertain feeling. Like, I could be fucking myself over right this second or I could very well be on my way to happiness that is so ridiculous that nothing else could ever compare. Both are probable outcomes. And maybe this time I want to follow my gut feeling. Or maybe this time I’m not going to take any chances. I’m not going to go all in and risk it all. Or maybe I will talk myself into it. Maybe I’m just going to have these never-ending circular arguments with my conscience till one of us gives in.
Because as much as I like how I’ve been feeling lately, my conscience is telling me to approach with caution. I guess I have my past experiences to blame for that because now I know better than to jump in unfamiliar waters, and even more so into familiar waters. Waters that were not so easily tread before but definitely swam in foolishly one too many times.
Truth is, I really want/need my simplistic days back, I want them tomorrow, the next day, and the day after that. I don’t hold the emotional or mental stability to deal with things that are completely and utterly beyond my control.
I’m freaking the fuck out and I don’t know exactly why. The only conclusion that I can come up with is that it’s because this is unlike anything I’ve ever stumbled upon and I don’t know what to do with it or what it will end up doing to me.
I figure the only thing I can do at this point is take a deep breath and forget anything that is rattling my bones, even if just a little, and be as happy as I was before everything started getting complicated.

Somewhere along the line, we metaphysically collided and limb after limb we entangled ourselves, effortlessly.
Even if there’s a missing piece in your logic and a small hole in my heart.
I can’t escape this time, not even if I actually wanted to try.

What’s to blame?
The ennui, the booze, the anxiety plus restlessness, the late nights, or the running I do to keep up with you.
But never can.

Lately,
it seems that I’m happiest when I’m talking to you.
And I can’t even begin to explain why.
How could this be happening if I’ve only begun to get to know you?
Quite frankly, within such a short time and short notice, I’ve become utterly intrigued and interested in all of this, and you.
Whatever this is, happening right now.
Whoever you are, charming stranger.
You leave me wanting more and I’ve never came across such a feat as that before.
Which makes you, and this, whatever it is, all the more fascinating.
Your words leave me at edges of cliffs completely awestruck and it’s not something I want to fully understand yet.
It seems to me that you are the only occurring thing that speaks to be real right now.
So, pardon me, if this is coming off too strong but you’ve taken me by surprise.
And I don’t see how I’m supposed to mind it at all.

Hey, if you're reading this. I think you're an amazing person. I really do. I may not know you, you may not know me but I still think you're great. I hope you see yourself the way I see you. Don't ever forget this, okay? You are golden and I love you just the way you are.

Really, what the hell was I thinking?

These are one of those times where things are certainly too good to be true.
I really don’t know why I thought that something like this would go exactly the way I wanted it to go.
That’s not how it works with me and I know that. My luck is flawed and so is my karma. And when you add in all the other variables, it just makes the whole situation and my thinking just a little more unrealistic. So why on earth did I talk myself into believing that something like this would actually happen to me.

I don’t know. In my perfect world, I wouldn’t be so hopeless to love and vulnerable to eternal happiness.

Please don’t be like the the others. I’m dangling by a single thread of hope that you’re different.

Why do you have to be so incredible?
What a heart stealer.

Why can’t people say what’s on their mind? Or what they feel? To the people that they want to hear it.
Fear of the unknown, perhaps? Fear of the response? Fear of the reaction? Is it really that scary to take the chance?
I mean, I was thinking about it and I realized that I hold back from saying things that eventually, I wish I had said at that particular time. I do this much too often, actually.
We are given all these chances to just say what we feel and we never once take it and when we finally convince ourselves to say it, we no longer have the chance.
So then you’re just stuck with the big what if?
And seriously, that is the most miserable way to live your life. Wishing you had done this or said that.
It’s awful.
So, the next time you think someone is cute, tell them. The next time someone makes your day, tell them. The next time someone talks to you disrespectfully, tell them. Whether it be your family, your friend, a stranger, take that chance.
It could change your life, it could change theirs, or it could just be a simple change. Who knows what could happen in that one instant.
But just do it. Don’t hesitate.

I don’t remember all of what I’d like to say. Turn the power buttons off and step outside into the rain. Smell the air from the wet asphalt and humidity, lay in the grass, lay in the street. Work hard. Quit your job. Go everywhere. Stay here. Think constantly. Be mindless. Read a book. Forget the English language entirely. Support gay rights. Form protests demanding same-sex marriage be illegal. Do what YOU feel. Do whatever you want, with no regard for anyone else, as long as your choices and actions do not restrict, limit, or stop anyone from making their own. This is your fucking life. There are no restart buttons and you won’t get another chance. This moment, right now, will NEVER happen again, and the opportunities you missed just here and now are infinite. The only thing I will ever tell another person to do is to create. Make something. Whether it’s a sandwich or the next Mona Lisa, create something that leaves YOU (a reflection of the thoughts, choices, actions of you) behind. Stop worrying about whether other people “support” you. Stop caring if what you do isn’t accepted. I know support and acceptance are not two things I have ever been lucky enough to have a lot of but that never stopped me. Going against the stream is so much more invigorating, I wouldn’t want it any other way.

I’m just so goddamn tired of hearing everyone telling me all the “right” things. Honestly, do you want to know what I think? Fuck off. That is what I think. I know every single person has intelligence and beauty to the moon, unfortunately, only about 4% of those people use any of it. None use all of it. “The world is too much with us” to be able to fully use our potentials. Every person has a thinking, living, computing, conniving, beautifully crafted mind. Please use it for yourself and let me use mine.

That’s all.

You know nothing about me.
Do you know what my favorite color is?
Do you know my whole name?
How about my birthday?
Or my favorite kind of cheesecake?
Do I even like cheesecake?
Or what song makes me cry?
Did you know that I love to write?
And sing?
Did you know that I can’t stand to drink unflavored water?
Did you know that I hate living in Hawaii?
Or that I could eat pasta for the rest of my life?
Or the fact that I want to go to space?
There is so much more to learn about me.
You don’t even know the half of it.
And I know little to nothing about you.
But that’s okay.
Because from what I do know.
The little things.
Maybe the most important things.
I have come to the conclusion.
That you’re pretty amazing.
Did you know that?

It seems that I’m dissatisfied with life. I’m discontent, or more so, just bored. I need excitement, I need something crazy to happen, something unexpected, something to ignite my joie de vivre once again.
I don’t want to admit that I need someone but maybe that’s exactly what’s missing. It’s a shame really to say that my happiness could lie in someone else’s hands at this point, since I’ve always striven to be independent.
I want to be able to derive happiness from within myself, not from someone who could potentially screw up my mindset and leave me sulking and pining over them in the end. Definitely not part of the plan.
But it’s coming to the point where my desperation to get out of this agonizing ‘stuck in a rut’ phase will make me act on my temptations and want to pursue dudes that I do, in fact, feel something for. Even if this feeling is lukewarm.
But then, conscientiously, I ask myself, “Then what?” I’ll get a boyfriend, things will go well but out jumps the possibility of me getting bored with him. And I don’t like that.
I don’t like dropping people out of my life because they’re boring. It’s an absolutely ridiculous thing to do.
Because why get into something with someone that you could potentially get bored of in the end? You’ll just end up in the exact same state of mind that you were in prior to all of it.
And before you know it, you’re onto your next conquest, to do the exact same thing.
So really, what is the point of all of this?
I don’t even know.

I always have these circular arguments with myself when it comes to stuff like this.
I always doubt my intentions for the sake of everyone except myself.
I’m losing it.
