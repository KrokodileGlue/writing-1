C EM THINGY THINGY2 6/8
end is C EM THINGY THINGY2

In your mind
Where do I lie
How much of my soul is left inside of you

Can I, have one last dance
Just need one more chance
To touch to smell to hold you

Just one single touch
I can't do that much
To hold inside me, this bleeding heart of mine

If I could have you again
My heartache would end
And I, could finally die inside your arms

arms, caressing me, holding me, while I die
