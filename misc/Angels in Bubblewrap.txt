Verse= G AM C D Jazzy chords

Black suits and skies of plastic
Compassion that's fake
Clean rooms and clean people
It's too much to take
Went home with my guitar
Then you came along
Life doesn't seem so bad
As I sing this song

C9ish? 
Each chord screams a moment
G
that's frozen in time
Am?
Each note that I scratch
D?
is my life line by line
Each song that I sing
is my soul ripped apart
to fretboards to music 
               G
to you my heart.

Hearing your heartbeat calms me
the touch of your skin
Eyes sing hymns of angels
Drowning my sin
The world seems cold and broken
Skies scattered stained glass
Bubblewrapped angels come as
my words turn to ash

Chorus

Bridge Em G Am D
The moon casts shadows as we lay under the sky
Your eyes are burning me, so to the stars I cry

Chorus
Chorus
End
Two hearts
