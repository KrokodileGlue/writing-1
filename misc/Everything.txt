C-ish Em-ish Am-ish G
To all those people who say they know
that they've loved and lost, but have they lost their soul?
Lost the only part that was really true
The part that gives a fuck about "I love you"

Because tonight I threw away the rest of my life
I threw away my future with this bloody knife
and my rasping words, like a heart attack
I'll spill my heart to try and win her back

C G Am G
So I scream to you, make you see that I care
Every note of every line will meet you there
And I cry out tears that no man should cry
Even if I have to do it for the rest of my life

So I scream to you, make you see that I tried
Every verse that I sing to repent for my lies
And I curse the sky and the sun above
Fuck you, fuck me, but mostly fuck love.


Verse
You can't forget the past is what they all say
That we can't be happy, there's no other way
They said end it already and find someone else
But babe I'd fight for you through the depths of hell

Am,Em,Am,Em
Bridge
Because I lost a part me, along the road of life
And the hole burns sharp and red each night
You're my Juliet with those morphine eyes
You took my broken wings and taught me flight

So I scream to you make you see that I care
Every note of every line will meet you there
And I cry out tears that no man should cry
Even if I have to do it for the rest of my life

So I scream to you, make you see that I tried
Every verse that I sing to repent for my lies
So I plead for you, and with this song I sing
I hope you realize, you're my everything.
