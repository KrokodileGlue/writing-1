Doing more than one drug at once, with a few exceptions, is selfish and just
a desire to get more fucked up, which usually leads to bad things.

Doing drugs is akin to switching personalities, or having another perspective on things,
because each drug is like being a completely different person, with differing
opinions and personalities.
