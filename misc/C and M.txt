Verse 1
Em C Am C9
It just another fight
We can't get through this night
But something shakes inside and tells me
That I can't be 
With you
this break we're on will last
cause I can't forget the past
And that's why I sit all alone

Chorus
G Am C Em C
So I lay here
thinking about our lives
remembering all the times
good and bad but I can't shake
the past why can't I
G Am C C9
just live
in the present and now
but I guess I have found
the reason I can't love you

Verse 2
There's too much pain here
I can't drink enough beer
to dull what stabs me every night
it rips apart my 
heart
I just can't restart
Because every little part
of you reminds me of the past

Bridge
Em C Am C9
His lips graze yours I can't look past
Your mouth around him, I hope it's fast
How does it feel, to have him inside of, you?
You kissed him soft, and held him tight
I can't forgive what went on that night
No matter what you say you know you wanted
what he did to you

Chorus
