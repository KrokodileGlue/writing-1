for my nicole.

for the person who reminded me 
what hope felt like
a small girl 
with a smile bigger than alone.

	Verse #1: G AM? C? D?

Black suits and skies of plastic
Compassion that's fake
Clean rooms and clean people
It's too much to take
then suddenly wings of white blurred
every inch of my being
the beautiful undertow of
your smile; my sea


	Chorus: C? G Am? D?

Each chord screams a moment
that's frozen in time
Each note that I scratch
is my life line by line
Each song that I sing
is my soul ripped apart
to fretboards to music           
          G
to you my heart.


	Verse #2

Hearing your heartbeat calms me
the touch of your skin
Eyes sing hymns of times past
Drowning my sin
without you each year more broken
Skies scattered stained glass
Bubblewrapped angels come as
my words turn to ash


	Chorus:


	Bridge: Em? G Am? D?

The moon casts shadows as we lay under the sky
Your lips burn right through me, so to the stars I cry


	Chorus: x2


	[Ending]
