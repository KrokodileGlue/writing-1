Wierd "pardon me chord", "A" thingy, kirstins songs chords. 1234

Warm dark sorrow and soft bright pain
stealing every hour of our day
Cold hearted women and back stabbing friends
It's a cold and sunny morning today

3,2,1,4
In this world where
Chivalry's as dead
as the kindness is all of our hearts
where love's just a cigarette, fresh from the pack
and being sober's just a dream in the dark


Drinking and smoking 'till our souls turn black
there's no tomorrow only today
where money and drugs will fill the hole in your heart
and love is just a condom away 


3,2,1,4
In this world where
Chivalry's as dead
as the kindness is all of our hearts
where love's just a cigarette, fresh from the pack
and being sober's just a dream in the dark
2,1,2,1,4
Cause I'm sick of all the words and smiles
that everybody fakes so well
So it seems the only one to trust
happens to be myself


2,1,2,1
Cause I'm sick of all the words and smiles
that everybody fakes so well
So it seems the only one to trust
happens to be myself

2,4,3,4,,1,4,2
I'm drunk and I'm high
and I'm fucked up and do
as I scream the only prayer I've got
That maybe someday I'll wake up...
