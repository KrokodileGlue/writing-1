1. You need a minimum of an hour to get ready before work or class.

2. Don’t hit the snooze button. If you gotta get up, then get up.

3. Shaving is more than a suggestion. That goes for men and double for women.

4. If you eat enough pizza, you will turn into a tub of oily cheese.

5. Running isn’t just for four-legged animals.
