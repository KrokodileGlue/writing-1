"Supposed you should be walking down Broadway after dinner, with ten minutes allotted to consummation of your cigar while you are choosing between a diverting tragedy and something serious in the way of vaudeville. Suddenly, a hand is laid upon your arm. You turn to look into the thrilling eyes of a beautiful woman, wonderful in diamonds and Russian sables. She thrusts hurriedly into your hand an extremely hot buttered roll, flashes out a tiny pair of scissors, snips off the second button of your overcoat, meaningly ejaculates the one word, "Parallelogram!" and swiftly flies down a cross street, looking back fearfully over her shoulder.



That would be pure adventure."

-O'Henry.
