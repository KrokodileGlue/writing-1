Sticks and stones may break my bones,<br>but words can break down walls.<br> The wall we keep inside us.<br> The walls that imprison and bind us.<br>The walls we build to keep ourselves in,<br>to hide, be tried, and to confide our sins in,<br>the ones we wish would fall.<br>I say these these words,<br>for what purpose I don't know,<br>I want to reach people, help them, touch their soul.<br>People every day hating, discriminating, killing, stealing.<br>Why?<br>Because we are different.<br>At least, we think we are different.<br>I see poems, touch songs, feel rights and taste wrongs,<br>hear smiles, and breathe happiness-<br>wish that people could feel the way I do.<br>Wish that people could hear the way I do.<br>With that people could see the way I do.<br>Wish that people could <b>love</b> the way I do.<br>Synesthesia.<br>In reality?<br>People do.<br>People taste,<br>people see,<br>people touch,<br>and people smell my words.<br>But do people <i>hear</i> my words?<br>Deep down inside, we're all really the same.<br>The hate, the fear, the love, the lies.<br>We all feel it, we all hide it, but we're the same.<br> We Laugh the same laughs, cry the same tears, smile the same smiles.<br> We <i>bleed</i> the same blood.<br>So why do we hate?<br>That's the question I guess.<br>We have to take it upon ourselves to find the answer.<br> To find out how to move backwards in time.<br> To find out how to regress our fragile minds.<br> To where we can live freely, think freely, laugh freely, and love freely.<br> Like children.

Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pron surfed, weak and weary, over many a strange and spurious site of "Hot XXX Galore". When I clicked my fav'rite bookmark, suddenly there came a warning, and my heart was filled with mourning, mourning for my dear amour -- " 'Tis not possible!", I muttered, "Give me back my free hardcore!"... Quoth the server: 404.


Jesus married to Mary Magdalene? No fucking way. I've read the Bible, folks, and I know there's no way Jesus was ever married. The guy never had a wife. Because no wife would buy The Resurrection story in a hundred fucking years. The disciples will, the believers will:but no wife would buy this fucking story. Good luck! Good luck with this story.

First of all, Jesus leaves on Friday afternoon with 12 other guys. He's gone for three days. No message. No way to get in touch with his wife. Then he comes home Monday afternoon looking like shit, like he hasn't slept. Looks like he's all partied out, man.

And Mrs. Jesus is just waiting, pacing around the home, going, "Okay, this is Day 3 of this shit:Well, look who's back! I'm glad you could find your way home, 'Mr. Savior'! Where's your 12 friends who won't get a job, huh?! Where're they at?! Yeah, 'disciples' my ass. They're LOSERS! Do you hear me? Every one of them are using you, Jesus, and you're not even smart enough to know it! Anyone who says to you 'I believe' we put them up and feed them! I'm sick of it! Where've you been?! Huh?"

And Jesus is rubbing his face, shaking his head, going, "I don't need this shit:not after what I went through this weekend:"

Then he goes, "No honey, I'll tell you where I've been. Come here. Come he-e-ere, honey. I'll tell you where I've been. First of all, not that it ruined your weekend any but I was DEAD!!! DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOU FUCKING BITCH?! I WAS DEEEAAADDD!!! WHILE YOU WERE SITTING AT HOME ON YOUR ASS, I'M IN A GRAVE OUTSIDE OF TOWN! I'M FIGHTING DEATH, HELL, DECOMPOSURE:I'M ABOUT TO TURN INTO A SPIRITUAL FORM AND GO INTO THE KINGDOM OF GOD, AND I GO, 'OH SHIT, WAIT A SECOND! I BETTER GO BACK HOME BECAUSE SHE DOESN'T KNOW WHERE I'VE BEEN!' SO NOW I'VE GOT TO FIGHT THE ANGEL OF DEATH, GET MY FUCKING SOUL BACK, CRAWL OUT OF THE GRAVE, AND COME HOME TO THIS SHIT: BECAUSE I MISSED YOU HONEY!!!"

No fucking way, man.




what do i do?

please stay..... please.... i've never told a boy to stay, to not leave, to not go. I've never confessed that before. Or told a boy i could only be with them... I've never been the one to beg or plead. ....i feel so pathetic. crying my FUCKING eyes out & letting people see me. I feel so pathetic to let you see me cry over you, to let you hear me beg, to be weak. but i had to try to beg & plead cuz if there was any chance that you wouldn't leave, i had to take it. i dont' understand why you didn't try to make it work... i don't understand how you can say you love me, then two seconds later walk away & leave me standing there crying.... i know you dont' want to hurt me, i don't blame you.... but i don't know what to do anymore...

Is it okay for you? to not be with me anymore? are you calm, strong & content ? Is everything all gee? Is that how it is for you?.... Knowing i'm better off?

I can't believe i'm going to go through a day without talking to you, seeing you, feeling your lips against mines, not hearing your voice, talking to you on the phone, have you tickle me, me tickle you, hug me, hold me, be with me.... wha



    * Be Impeccable With Your Word. Speak with integrity. Say only what you mean. Avoid using the word to speak against yourself or to gossip about others. Use the power of your word in the direction of truth and love.

    * Don’t Take Anything Personally. Nothing others do is because of you. What others say and do is a projection of their own reality, their own dream. When you are immune to the opinions and actions of others, you won’t be the victim of needless suffering.

    * Don’t Make Assumptions. Find the courage to ask questions and to express what you really want. Communicate with others as clearly as you can to avoid misunderstandings, sadness and drama. With just this one agreement, you can completely transform your life.

    * Always Do Your Best. Your best is going to change from moment to moment; it will be different when you are healthy as opposed to sick. Under any circumstance, simply do your best, and you will avoid self-judgment, self-abuse and regret.
