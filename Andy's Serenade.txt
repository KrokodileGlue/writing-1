7-9 chord 5-7 chord 3-5 chord 5-7 chord

Sweet, sweet smile over broken glass
drink up babe, you'll forget the past
I'll keep you safe, in these chords I write for you

My fingers bleed for every tear you cry
My broken girl, only tried
to please
and now she sees...only

c:
fake smiles and paper hearts
she can't be broken if she never cared to start...
and now she sees...only

lies and lust behind every word
love and happiness seem absurd to her
what is left... not a single bit of hope

nothing can fill that longing hole
from that night, when he stole
your soul
but I can try

afraid to trust, won't happen again
you can't give me what wasn't there to begin
but I can try... with my

c:
real smiles and loving heart
don't care what's broken, I'll fix every single part
I hope you see...my

truth and care behind every word
I'll soothe every cry that I've ever heard from you
maybe then... you'll let me in
