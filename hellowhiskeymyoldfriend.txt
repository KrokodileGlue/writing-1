hello whiskey, my old friend.

yes, it’s really me.

i know it’s been a long time
you must have been lonely
and-

yes, there is something wrong

i know.
i know.

i only call when something is wrong
when everything falls apart.
when the bottles of pills are as empty
as my metaphors.

i know.

i’m a shit friend.
i should call when i have good news
when it’s not so heavy to smile
when it’s not so heavy to live.

i know
i know
god
do i know

but you are all i have
when the light bulbs of the world all burn out
and the keystrokes are the only company i keep
and
and
and-

goddammit.

so please help.
i’m begging you.

because the world crushed me today.
as atlas shrugged
as the sidewalk ended
as all of the mice
as all of the fucking men
branded scarlet letters
into my flesh
as every inch of burnt skin
was lorded over
by the flies.
as nothingness
was all i owned anymore.

give me the greatness of gatsby
give me a tale that will be read in more than two cities
give me pride worthy of prejudice
give me people who will expect greatness from me.
give me art
give me war

give me

something.
please.

but no
here i sit
talking to whiskey and wine
like some madman.

with books of genius i am guilty of ignoring
five feet away
too fucking far for me apparently
an odyssey
an iliad
too fucking afraid of adventure
put to shame by huckleberry-fucking-finn.

so i guess that’s my crime
and my punishment is appropriate
never beautiful
forever damned

just another generic soul.
just another 

of les misérables.
