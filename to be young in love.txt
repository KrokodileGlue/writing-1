to be young in love.

the screech of cellphones
breaking the calm night

staring at ceilings
pushing down nausea
fighting imaginary demons
antiseptic and cold

i can't know it right now
but this will be
the most important call
of my life

i'm much too drunk
much too annoyed
at nothing
at everything

i can't close my eyes
for fear of throwing up
so fuck it
i answer

i am ashamed to admit,
i can't even remember
what we talked about
that night

i can't remember what
or who
or why
or when

i just remember you.

i remember whisky
i rmemeber laughter
i remember rapture
i remember lighting
i remember ambien
i temmeber corny jokes
i remmeber metaphors of love

i remember nails
scarring my back
apocalyptic and colorblind.

everything is a blur after that
everything seemed to move
far too fast
time fidgeting
under the weight of you

i don't know why
it all`seems so far now
there were wonderful nights
elation
smilesâ€”

the smalls of our backs
staining the bedsheets underneath us
the smell of you
my poison of choice

the days now are forced and lonely
useless people
with useless problems

rain where the music used to be.

the rooftops are silent
wet and damp
the night is screaming
the stars pretending calm

i guess maybe someday
i'll figure out the truth
i guess maybe some days
you need nights like this

nights full of cigarette smoke

silent and useless.
