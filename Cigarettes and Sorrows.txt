intro a,e

E,B5,A,B5
The cold night air bites my lips as I stutter to you on the phone
I struggle to joke and laugh, make you smile before you have to go
C#5, B5, A B5
While I scream in my head at how stupid I was
Then your boyfriend calls and I'm all alone

A(ish)                C#5
I'm sorry I'm sorry I hurt you
A                                          B5
'cause this this hole in my heart's burning sure
and I'm sorry I'm sorry I left you
       A                         B5                         INTRO
because cigarettes and sorrows are all i have left anymore

E,B5,A,B5
Each time that I see you kiss him, a part of me dies deep inside
I can't forget how it felt, those memories I've tried to hide
C#5, B5, A B5
Your touch and I'm crashing, Your lips and I'm burning
I'm dying, all cause of you

A(ish)                C#5
I'm sorry I'm sorry I hurt you
(I'm sorry I'm sorry I)
A                                          B5
'cause this this hole in my heart's burning sure
(hole in my heart)
and I'm sorry I'm sorry I left you
(sorry I'm sorry I)
       A                         B5               
because cigarettes and sorrows are all i have left
A(ish)                C#5
I'm sorry I'm sorry I hurt you
(Each glance that you shoot me sends chills up my spine)
A                                          B5
'cause this this hole in my heart's burning sure
(As I remember how it used to be)
and I'm sorry I'm sorry I left you
(and each smile that you fake leaves me burning inside)
       A                         B5     
because cigarettes and sorrows are all i have left anymore
(but it's alright, more or less, less or more.)
